Hello sir and mam I am Puneet Shukla
so let me quickly explain what this code does 

Sir it is a simple checkout system that I have written in Python
The idea is I have got four items A, B, C, D each has a price, and a group of them have also offers discount 
For example if you buy 3 A items, you get them for 130 instead of 150  same for B

Sir I used counter to  count how many times each item purchased
and sir then i loop through each item andcheck if it enable for a discount and if yes i apply the offer as times as possible and extra gets billed at the normal price
and those cases there are no offers in that case it just multiplies the item count by its price and in the end i added multiple test cases with different combinations of items

Sir I also run my code in vs code and it runs perfect withhh correct total price outpuut

and thank you sir/mam for taking the time to review my assignment i really and enjoy to learn new problem statement
